        In Brief | Strategic Plan The University of the People (UoPeople) is the
        Education Revolution. It is the first non-profit, tuition-free,
        American, accredited, online university. Dedicated to opening access to
        higher education globally, UoPeople helps high school graduates overcome
        financial, geographic, political, and personal constraints keeping them
        from college studies. UNESCO estimates that by the year 2025, there will
        be nearly 100 million young people unable to find seats in traditional
        universities. UoPeople believes that access to higher education is a
        basic right which promotes world peace and global economic development;
        and it is committed to providing those young people a quality higher
        education – tuition free. As the United Nations High Commissioner for
        Education (and former British Prime Minister) Gordon Brown has put it:
        “University of the People is offering a quality education to tens of
        thousands of qualified students who, without it, would have no chance at
        all. What’s more, with its growing network of partnerships, it can turn
        those tens of thousands into hundreds of thousands and someday even
        millions.” UoPeople was founded in 2009 and accredited in February 2014.
        The University offers associate and bachelor’s degree programs in
        Business Administration, Computer Science, and Health Science as well as
        master’s degree programs in Business Administration and Education.
        University of the People in Arabic was launched in 2020, offering
        associate and bachelor’s degrees in Business Administration, while
        simultaneously providing these Arabic-speaking students intensive
        English-language courses. There presently are more than 100,000 students
        enrolled from more than 200 countries and territories. Over 7,000 of
        these students are refugees. UoPeople is staffed by thousands of
        volunteers, including its Founder and President, Shai Reshef, the
        distinguished members of its international boards of trustees and
        advisors, and its faculty. The President’s Council is chaired by John
        Sexton, NYU’s President Emeritus, and consists of two dozen other
        leaders from the world’s foremost institutions (see here for the full
        list). More than 26,000 professionals have volunteered for leadership
        roles, serving as provost, as deans, as administrators, or as faculty.
        UoPeople has built a sustainable and scalable model to serve those
        millions whose talent and creativity is being lost today. Courses are
        delivered online to a group of typically 20-30 students who study the
        material together under the direction of a faculty member. A bachelor’s
        degree requires completion of 40 courses. Each nine-week course is based
        on a curriculum drawn from Open Educational Resources (OER) materials,
        so there is no textbook or materials cost. The only time a student is
        asked to pay any amount is at the end of a course. For students who can
        afford it there is an assessment fee of $120 for an undergraduate course
        or $240 for a graduate-level course. This fee, which is waived if a
        student warrants that he or she cannot afford it, helps defray the
        university’s operational costs, allowing UoPeople to remain sustainable
        and still ultra-low cost. UoPeople has collaborations with the
        University of Edinburgh, Effat University, Long Island University,
        McGill University and NYU. Each of these schools has used UoPeople to
        identify talented students to whom they have provided admission and
        generous financial aid. UoPeople not only provides its students with a
        quality degree but also provides them a way to demonstrate their talent
        and readiness for spots in the student bodies of the world’s leading
        universities. In addition, UoPeople has partnered with Harvard Business
        School Online to allow UoPeople students to participate in Harvard’s
        online courses. Upon graduation, 92% of those who receive degrees of any
        kind at UoPeople are employed, including at companies such as Amazon,
        Apple, Dell, Deloitte, IBM, Microsoft, and JP Morgan, and organizations
        such as the UN and the World Bank. UoPeople is supported by the
        generosity of individuals and foundations, including the Gates, Hewlett,
        and Ford Foundations, Fondation Hoffmann, and others. The University has
        been covered by the New York Times, BBC, NPR, Times Higher Education, US
        News and World Report, and more. President Reshef’s TED Talk and Nas
        Daily interview about the University have 30 million views combined.
