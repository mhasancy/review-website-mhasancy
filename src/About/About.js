        The Open Source University (OSU) is the Education Revolution. It is the
        first non-profit, tuition-free, American, accredited, online university.
        Dedicated to opening access to higher education globally, OSU helps high
        school graduates overcome financial, geographic, political, and personal
        constraints keeping them from college studies. UNESCO estimates that by
        the year 2025, there will be nearly 100 million young people unable to
        find seats in traditional universities. OSU believes that access to
        higher education is a basic right which promotes world peace and global
        economic development; and it is committed to providing those young
        people a quality higher education – tuition free. As the United Nations
        High Commissioner for Education (and former British Prime Minister)
        Gordon Brown has put it: “University of the People is offering a quality
        education to tens of thousands of qualified students who, without it,
        would have no chance at all. What’s more, with its growing network of
        partnerships, it can turn those tens of thousands into hundreds of
        thousands and someday even millions.” OSU was founded in 2009 and
        accredited in February 2014. The University offers associate and
        bachelor’s degree programs in Business Administration, Computer Science,
        and Health Science as well as master’s degree programs in Business
        Administration and Education. University of the People in Arabic was
        launched in 2020, offering associate and bachelor’s degrees in Business
        Administration, while simultaneously providing these Arabic-speaking
        students intensive English-language courses. There presently are more
        than 100,000 students enrolled from more than 200 countries and
        territories. Over 7,000 of these students are refugees. <br /> <br />{" "}
        OSU is staffed by thousands of volunteers, including its Founder and
        President, Shai Reshef, the distinguished members of its international
        boards of trustees and advisors, and its faculty. The President’s
        Council is chaired by John Sexton, NYU’s President Emeritus, and
        consists of two dozen other leaders from the world’s foremost
        institutions (see here for the full list). More than 26,000
        professionals have volunteered for leadership roles, serving as provost,
        as deans, as administrators, or as faculty. OSU has built a sustainable
        and scalable model to serve those millions whose talent and creativity
        is being lost today. Courses are delivered online to a group of
        typically 20-30 students who study the material together under the
        direction of a faculty member. A bachelor’s degree requires completion
        of 40 courses. Each nine-week course is based on a curriculum drawn from
        Open Educational Resources (OER) materials, so there is no textbook or
        materials cost. The only time a student is asked to pay any amount is at
        the end of a course. For students who can afford it there is an
        assessment fee of $120 for an undergraduate course or $240 for a
        graduate-level course. This fee, which is waived if a student warrants
        that he or she cannot afford it, helps defray the university’s
        operational costs, allowing OSU to remain sustainable and still
        ultra-low cost. OSU has collaborations with the University of Edinburgh,
        Effat University, Long Island University, McGill University and NYU.
        Each of these schools has used OSU to identify talented students to whom
        they have provided admission and generous financial aid. <br /> <br />{" "}
        OSU not only provides its students with a quality degree but also
        provides them a way to demonstrate their talent and readiness for spots
        in the student bodies of the world’s leading universities. In addition,
        OSU has partnered with Harvard Business School Online to allow OSU
        students to participate in Harvard’s online courses. Upon graduation,
        92% of those who receive degrees of any kind at OSU are employed,
        including at companies such as Amazon, Apple, Dell, Deloitte, IBM,
        Microsoft, and JP Morgan, and organizations such as the UN and the World
        Bank. OSU is supported by the generosity of individuals and foundations,
        including the Gates, Hewlett, and Ford Foundations, Fondation Hoffmann,
        and others. The University has been covered by the New York Times, BBC,
        NPR, Times Higher Education, US News and World Report, and more.

        have 30 million views combined.
