        Research is "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the
        stock of knowledge".[1] It involves the collection, organization, and
        analysis of information to increase understanding of a topic or issue. A
        research project may be an expansion on past work in the field. To test
        the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may
        replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The
        primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are
        documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and
        development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human
        knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary
        considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are
        several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic,
        social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,
        etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as
        meta-research. Open Source University This initiative has been taken to
